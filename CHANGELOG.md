## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0.alpha1] - unreleased

### Breaking changes

- `ReversibleId` now no longer downcases the encodedid input string by default on decode, ie the `decode` option `downcase` is now `false`. In a future release the `downcase` option will be removed.

## [1.0.0.rc4] - unreleased

- Add an optional `max_inputs_per_id` argument to `ReversibleId`, thanks to [@avcwisesa](https://github.com/avcwisesa)
- The option `split_with:` can also now be set to nil to disable splitting of the encoded ID string

## [1.0.0.rc3] - 2023-10-23

- Add an optional `max_length` argument to `ReversibleId`, thanks to [@jugglebird](https://github.com/jugglebird)
- Alphabet validations to prevent whitespace and null chars
- Add `Alphabet#to_a`, `Alphabet#to_s`, `Alphabet#size` and a custom `Alphabet#inspect`
- Fixes to input validations
- hashids are case-sensitive, as are `Alphabet`s, however `ReversibleId` was always `downcase`ing the encodedid input string on decode. A new option has been added to `decode` and `decode_hex`, `downcase`, which defaults to `true`. Thus, the default behaviour is unchanged, but you can opt out to allow mixed case encodedid decode. *Note:* In V2 this will default to `false`.

## [1.0.0.rc2] - 2023-08-07
